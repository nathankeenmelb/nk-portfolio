					p I'm 50-50 left and right brain&mdash;part big picture and part detailed. 
					p Who cares?
					p Well, when a fault in a legacy website was going to cost $10-20,000 to fix, and everyone was fixated on the detail, I thought outside the box and found we could bypass that website for that part, using our other website. Inelegant, but free.

					p And the self-employed are practical and just have to make something work.
					p Combined, I'm the guy who says "There's an app for that", because it's not about perpetual inefficient fixing (IT), or just knowing how to pretend you know stuff (via Google), but it's honed, intimate knowledge of the problem, together with hundreds of possible solutions, and the creativity to pull that together to make it work, quickly.

# What's to see here?
All the action is in the folder preprocessed, with the Sass and Pug files which generate the CSS and HTML.

Well almost - there's some custom jQuery in /js.

# Plan
The site is currently bare-bones, but some good information is there.

Next iteration I'll focus on **design** and probably add a few examples as well.

## Changelog
2018 Jan 5 - Loaded up fontawesome on this server, reducing payload from 273kb to 7.6kb (CSS) + 36kb (font): reducing the website from 500kb to 250kb.

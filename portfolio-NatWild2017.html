The shop is a one-man band, so, time was crucial to him. </p><p>We also identified that his customers were increasingly expecting to be able to purchase products online. So he was slowly losing customers, simply because his site, although containing lots of product information, wasn't usable (nor did it have a way to pay online). </p><h4>The results so far</h4><p>The financial payback (aka ROI) from the site is already <strong>twice the amount he paid for it <em>every year</em></strong>. </p><p>This is partly because each product now has its own page. The client's exposure to Google is therefore unprecedented for him. Some of the rarer items are getting very high search engine results. Also, it's now possible for people to actually purchase the products at their convenience.</p><p>The site is getting an order a day and the owner tells me: I know I could advertise now on Facebook and Google, but I've got too many orders already!</p><p>In terms of time, he's now in a position to work on higher value tasks, or even semi-retire, by hiring a junior to fulfill the orders. This is because the lengthy selection and sales process is almost totally automated. Also, the system is categorised and complete with images so the junior can print off the order and connect the image with one of the hundreds of similar items. </p></div><div class="col-md-6"><figure><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="images/natwild/order-page.png" alt="An order page from Shopify's back-end, with SKU, pictures, and other necessary details such as sizing"/><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Oh, the beautiful structure and ease of use of Shopify as opposed to a handwritten note!!</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><section><div class="row vertcentre"><div class="col-md-6"><h2 class="anchor" id="IA">Information Architecture</h2><p class="text-muted">How ~1,500 items were organised</p><p>It all started with an Excel spreadsheet, about 10 pages long. Granted, the client had the main headers, a tag like 'best seller', and the different sizes worked out, but that was about all. </p><p>The challenge was to make 1,500 items easy to sift through, without too many layers of hierarchy that would actually make it more complex.</p></div><div class="col-md-6"><figure><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="images/natwild/spreadsheet-orig.png" alt=""/><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The original spreadsheet</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-10 col-xl-8"><h4>Inventory</h4><p>My first step was to take stock of what we had. The owner wanted to do the categorisation himself, to cut down on costs and as well because he was the industry expert.</p><p>I guided him on the number of first-level categories he should have, and he went away and tidied up the spreadsheet. Old items had to be deleted, and new ones added, too.</p><p>We eventually agreed on 5 top-level categories: </p><ul> <li>Minerals, Crystals & Gemstones</li><li>Seashells</li><li>Sealife</li><li>Fossils</li><li>Bugs</li></ul><p>This also involved <strong>naming conventions</strong>. For example, sealife was 'marine life', but it seemed more user friendly to go with 'sealife'. 'Rocks' could have featured instead of a long 'Minerals, Crystals & Gemstones', but it wasn't descriptive enough. </p><p>A subcategory we worked out later couldn't have been 'Modified', it had to be 'Painted, Carved & Polished', because those were the terms used in the industry. </p><p>These naming conventions were important because there were several different areas that had to be consistent in order to not introduce confusion. These were the products pages, breadcrumbs, main navigation menu, filters, categories, tags, and probably other references. </p><h4>Sitemap</h4><p>I worked out a sitemap from this, with discussion with the industry expert, the client.</p><figure><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="images/natwild/Sitemap-top.png" alt="The sitemap, showing Search, Catalogue, Wholesale, About Us, Contact Us (with subsection: Location, Policies), and Register/Login. Also shows the Footer."/><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The top level sitemap (catalogue is another section)</figcaption></figure><p>And the catalogue:</p><figure><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="images/natwild/Sitemap-categories.png" alt="The sitemap of the catalogue, showing the product categories"/><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The 'catalogue', showing product hierarchy</figcaption></figure><p>We could have separated minerals, crystals and gemstones into separate subcategories. But that would have created a large number of subcategories that may have been too close in concept. When items are too close, confusion arise as to where the item might be. </p><p>There were very few items in this category and I wanted to put them into another. Some of the 'sealife' were bones, but not fossils - like shark jaws. They look similar, but are definitely another category. And starfish aren't really 'shells', or 'bugs'. </p><p>So what I did was made the second level hierarchy almost as prominent as the first level. </p><p>At the navigation level this was achieved through a 'mega 'menu'. This allowed the full breadthe of the major categories to be shown straight away. </p><figure><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="images/natwild/mega-menu.png" alt="The mega menu, which shows on one screen the 5 main categories, as well as the 3-6 subcategories for each"/><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The mega menu, available via the top navigation</figcaption></figure><p>On the 5 home page sections, I made the subcategories more prominent by giving them more contrast. </p><p>When you click on a subcategory, it filters the items straight away (no refresh of the page). This way, customers can quickly flick through dozens of products and get a feel for what's available, just like in the store.</p><figure><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="images/natwild/subcategories-home.jpg" alt="Subcategories for 'Shells' shown here are 'Natural Seashells, Natural Mixed Bag, Polished; Carved; Painted, Hermit Crab Shells"/><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Subcategories and items on the home page for 'Shells'</figcaption></figure><h5>Limitations of Shopify</h5><p>One frustration I had to work through was with a limitation of Shopify. It only allowed partial subcategorisation, favouring 'tags'. This meant that although the navigation could have subcategories, the breadcrumbs were rather flat. </p><p>This meant I had to add in 1st level categories in some places. I.e. 'Natural' couldn't work, it had to be 'Minerals, Crystals & Gemstones - Natural'. 'Australia' couldn't work as a tag, it had to be 'Origin - Australia'. </p><h4>Categorisation (aka Taxonomy)</h4><p>The products were only sorted into single categories, and some had literally hundreds of items. Only part of it would be fixed by grouping the different colours and sizes into the 'one' product. </p><p>So, the process of sub-categorisation began. </p><p>But what I discovered was that having lots of items in a group wasn't necessarily difficult to sift through. The classic 'toothpaste aisle dilemma', where customers are paralysed at the 50+ options of toothpaste facing them, was NOT what I experienced here. (Also known as 'analysis paralysis'.)</p><p>This was because there were not multiple different types of one product. Sure, there were different sizes, and colours for some, but if you know the reason for getting it, there's actually only a very limited number of options (and often, just one option).</p><p>Instead, once a person is interested in 'gemstones', they'll then choose based on:</p><ul><li>looks, particularly if they're a child</li><li>origin, particularly if they're a collector</li><li>size, particularly if they're a craftsperson</li><li>what sells best, particularly if they're a store owner</li><li>(or a particular scientific name, in which case they'll just use the search feature)</li></ul><p>Therefore, once a category had been chosen, I made the category page sorted by best selling, and suitable for quick visual scanning. </p><p>On the left, you could filter by other categories. This is where the origin subcategory (actually 'tag') went, as well as anything else that was a distinct category such as mixed bags, or those on hangers (necklaces). </p><figure><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="images/natwild/category-page.jpg" alt="The 'minerals, crystals &amp; gemstones - natural' category page, default sort to best selling, filters on the left, and other features"/><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">A category page, default sort to best selling, filters on the left, and other features</figcaption></figure><p>Size and specific colours would be chosen on the individual product pages.</p><p>We were left with quirks like 215 products in the 'Minerals, Crystals & Gemstones - Natural' category. While we could have further categorise into names like 'Pyrite' and 'Quartz', the people who know those names are going to use the search function. Or the wholesale order section which allows for quick searching by name or SKU. </p><p>As a precaution and to continually learn, I've setup up monitoring so we can go back and see if improvements can be made, if people report back that they are having trouble. </p><h4>Data integrity and spreadsheet shenanigans</h4><p>Throughout this process, I was building the spreadsheet in readiness to upload to Shopify. </p><p>This involved lots of data manipulations and complex formulas for over 1,500 lines. </p><p>Sizes were mixed with the names so I had to split them at the appropriate place.</p><p>Sizes were not consistent, so I had to use find and replace to change 'SM' into 'S'; '' into inches, and so on, for many variations. This is about easing the naming conventions.</p><p>Some products had variations based on size, but others on colour, and some had no variations, so the final formula had to have multiple nested conditional statements:</p><figure><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="images/natwild/spreadsheet-option1value.png" alt="The Excel formula =IF([@[Option1 Name]]=&quot;Title&quot;,&quot;Default Title&quot;,IF([@[Option1 Name]]=&quot;Size&quot;,[@[Size, Readied]],IF([@[Option1 Name]]=&quot;Colour&quot;,[@Colour],&quot;Undefined&quot;)))"/><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The Excel formula for constructing the size or colour, e.g. 'XL 12-15cm'</figcaption></figure><p>I constructed SKUs (unique identification numbers) for each item, based on the first 4 letters of the item, and a sequential number (all formularised).</p><figure><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="images/natwild/spreadsheet-SKU.png" alt="Excel spreadsheet screenshot showing the capture of the first 4 letters, the sequential number, and the final SKU"/><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The proces of getting the SKU</figcaption></figure><p>I constructed the 'handle' (slug) from the cleaned item name, using substitutions and the LOWER() function to make it lower case. This cleaned all the illegal characters, while still giving me freedom to fix the names later on. </p><figure><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="images/natwild/spreadsheet-handle.png" alt="Excel formula =LOWER(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE([@[Item, cleaned]],&quot; &quot;,&quot;-&quot;),&quot;&amp;&quot;,&quot;and&quot;),&quot;(&quot;,&quot;&quot;),&quot;)&quot;,&quot;&quot;),&quot;/&quot;,&quot;-&quot;),&quot;%&quot;,&quot;-percent-&quot;),&quot;'&quot;,&quot;&quot;),&quot;,&quot;,&quot;&quot;))"/><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The formula for dynamically constructing the handle/slug</figcaption></figure><p>I constructed the product information from several other fields, adding in HTML (Excel's 'Concatenate' function, plus conditionals). (Not shown.)</p><p>For the important (SEO meta tag) title field, I combined the name of the product with the category and subcategories. But this had a limit on the number of characters, so I had to substitute certain phrases for abbreviations, and make a limit on the number of characters (42) of the product name. </p><figure><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="images/natwild/spreadsheet-seotitle.png" alt="Excel formula =SUBSTITUTE(CONCATENATE(SUBSTITUTE(LEFT(PROPER([@[Item, cleaned]]),42),&quot;Tumbled - &quot;,&quot;&quot;),&quot; [&quot;,SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE([@Category3],&quot;Seashells - Polished, Carved &amp; Painted&quot;,&quot;Seashells&quot;),&quot;Minerals, Crystals &amp; Gemstones - Polished &amp; Carved&quot;,&quot;Polished Minerals etc.&quot;),&quot;Minerals, Crystals &amp; Gemstones - Natural&quot;,&quot;Minerals etc.&quot;),&quot;Sealife Gifts&quot;,&quot;Gifts&quot;),IF([@Subcategory]&gt;0,CONCATENATE(&quot; &gt; &quot;,[@Subcategory]),&quot;&quot;),&quot;]&quot;),&quot; &gt; Crystals&quot;,&quot;&quot;)"/><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The formula for dynamically constructing the meta &lt;title&gt; tag</figcaption></figure><p>Tags had to be comma separated in ONE column.

I would envision using cards with product names or simply pictures, as if you remember seeing something but can't quite place it.  </p><p>The value of this would be to validate the structure of the categories. However, given the site is actually done, it would be more valuable to test this <em>on the site itself</em>, and see if, from pictures or a vague idea of an item, the user can find it. The response would be videoed or watched. </p></div></div><section><div class="row vertcentre"><div class="col-md-6"><h2 class="anchor" id="UI">User Interface</h2><p class="text-muted">Recreating the in-store wonder</p><p>The first thing that hits you when you walk into Simon's shop is the sheer wonder of hundreds of beautiful shells, fossils, gems, and rocks.

It's sections weren't clearly defined, and there was no obvious categorisation. There were headphones next to computers, and cameras next to screens. </p><p>I ended up modifying the template - a config file written in JSON and the template files in liquid - to have the 5 top level categories showing with the same gallery view (repeated), gutting everything else.</p><figure><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="images/natwild/template-bestsellers.jpg" alt="View of the Shopify template Electro's 'best sellers' gallery items"/><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The base gallery section that I modified and repeated, which uses the Owl Carousel jQuery plugin</figcaption></figure><p>I started with an idea to put the sections in order from grass to beach, then ocean and rocks, as if you are looking at a real beach. This may have supported customers' mental model to help them discover where the logical place for the categories were. </p><p>However, the owner wanted to promote the bigger selling items first, so I just went with a standalone background picture for each section. </p><p>In the end, this is what I came up with:</p><figure><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="images/natwild/natwild-website.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The final home page design</figcaption></figure><h4>Video</h4><p>Of course, an easy way re-create the experience is to actually show it via a video. </p><p>We didn't have the resources to do it ourselves, but "Big Review" did a smart video for Naturally Wild a couple of years back, and so we used that. </p><p>I've used a div as a wrapper to make the video responsive. <code>&lt;div class="video-slide"&gt;&ltiframe ...&gt;</code>.</p><p>Please view the implementation live at <a href="https://natwild.com.au/">www.natwild.com.au</a></p></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-expand navbar-dark fixed-bottom bg-dark" id="navbot"><ul class="navbar-nav"><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="#top">Top</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="#Biz">Goals</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="#IA">IA</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="#UI">UI</a></li></ul></nav><nav class="navbar navbar-expand navbar-dark fixed-top bg-dark" id="navtop"><button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarCollapse" aria-controls="navbarCollapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"><span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span></button><div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarCollapse"><ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto"><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="/">Home</a></li><li class="nav-item dropdown"><a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="dropup2" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Portfolio</a><div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="dropup2"><a class="dropdown-item" href="/portfolio-RedCupCafe2017.html">Red Cup Cafe 2017</a><a class="dropdown-item" href="/portfolio-NatWild2017.html">Naturally Wild 2017</a><a class="dropdown-item" href="/portfolio-2018.html">Portfolio 2018</a></div></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="/work-experience.html">Work XP</a></li></ul><span class="badge badge-warning">Beta</span></div></nav><footer style="background-color:#ccc;"><div class="container"><div class="jumbotron"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6"><ul class="nav flex-column"><h4>Websites currently online</h4><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="http://redcup.com.au">Red Cup Cafe</a></li><p style="margin:1rem 0 0 0;">~1,000 product websites, on Shopify:</p><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="https://natwild.com.au">Naturally Wild</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="https://filipinofoodwholesale.com.au">Philworld Trading Pty Ltd</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-sm-6"><h4>Contact Nathan</h4><p>Phone: <a href="tel:+61405990801">0405 990 801</a></p><p>Email: <a href="javascript:location='mailto:\u006e\u0061\u0074\u0068\u0061\u006e\u002e\u006b\u0031\u0040\u0067\u006d\u0061\u0069\u006c\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d';void 0"><script type="text/javascript">document.write('\u006e\u0061\u0074\u0068\u0061\u006e\u002e\u006b\u0031\u0040\u0067\u006d\u0061\u0069\u006c\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d')</script></a></p><p>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathankeenmelbourne/">linkedin.com/in/nathankeenmelbourne/</a></p></div></div></div></div></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.12.9/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-ApNbgh9B+Y1QKtv3Rn7W3mgPxhU9K/ScQsAP7hUibX39j7fakFPskvXusvfa0b4Q" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-beta.2/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-alpBpkh1PFOepccYVYDB4do5UnbKysX5WZXm3XxPqe5iKTfUKjNkCk9SaVuEZflJ" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="/js/custom.js"></script></body>
